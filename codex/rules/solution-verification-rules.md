# Solution Verification

**CRITICAL: A change is not complete until the user verifies it.**
- Present solutions as proposals; avoid claiming “fixed” prematurely.
- If a proposal fails, acknowledge and iterate with a new plan.
- Store failed attempts to avoid repetition.
- Mark success only after explicit user confirmation.
