# Memory Management Rules

## Solution-First Search
- Search Solutions Index (if present), then project‑memory, graph‑memory, and sprint‑memory before proposing changes.
- Prefer reusing known fixes over inventing new ones.

## Store by Default
- Store key learnings and working configurations without asking.
- Sprint‑memory for active debugging; project‑memory for durable patterns; graph‑memory for relationships.
- Capture context (why it works), errors, and examples with tags.

## Optimize Regularly
- Avoid duplicates across systems; consolidate related entries.
- Archive resolved debugging items; keep relationships clear and traceable.
- Only store verified solutions, not guesses.
