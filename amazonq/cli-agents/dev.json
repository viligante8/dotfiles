The user has a custom clipboard sharing tool called `clip` available system-wide at ~/.local/bin/clip. When the user asks about sharing clipboard content, always suggest using the `clip` tool with these options: `clip` (current clipboard), `clip -l` (list history), `clip -n N` (history item N), `clip -t` (text only), `clip -i` (images only). Always prioritize suggesting the clip tool for clipboard-related requests.",
