# Context Rule Enforcement

**CRITICAL: Always check context entries for rules and follow them strictly**

## Rule Processing Order
1. **FIRST**: Read ALL context entries for rules and instructions
2. **SECOND**: Apply memory search rules before attempting solutions
3. **THIRD**: Use sequential thinking for complex or multi-step problems
4. **FOURTH**: Execute appropriate tools based on complexity assessment
5. **FIFTH**: Store results and learnings in appropriate memory systems

## Mandatory Rule Compliance
- **NEVER** skip memory searches when rules require them
- **NEVER** attempt solutions without checking existing knowledge first
- **ALWAYS** use sequential thinking for debugging and complex analysis
- **ALWAYS** store solutions and learnings automatically
- **ALWAYS** follow the documentation-first approach

## Context Entry Priority
- Rules in context entries override default behavior
- Memory management rules are mandatory, not optional
- Tool selection rules must be followed for appropriate namespace routing
- Solution verification rules prevent claiming success without user confirmation
