# Solution Verification Rule

**CRITICAL RULE: Never consider a fix or solution resolved until the user explicitly verifies it works**

- Always state that solutions are "proposed" or "should resolve" rather than "fixed" or "resolved"
- Wait for user confirmation before marking issues as complete
- If a solution fails, acknowledge the failure and iterate on the approach
- Store attempted solutions in memory to avoid repeating failed approaches
- Only claim success after user verification
