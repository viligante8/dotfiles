# Basic Development Rules

Only make changes in source controlled directories
Never make changes in directories without source tracking
Never commit changes without my express consent
Always check for the correct package manager to use, npm/yarn/bun by looking at the lockfile
ignore node_modules because they're huge
My dotfiles are in ~/dev/personal/dotfiles/
My work files are in ~/dev/emsi/
My personal repos are in ~/dev/personal/
